# lisp-in-ruby 
 A lisp interpreter written ruby, made for the purpose of personal education.
 
 Developed in a TDD manner and hence it is extensively covered by tests.
 Features include:
 - Custom Error Handling
 - Tail Call Optimization
 - Common Data Structures
 - Extensive testing with 90+ assertions
 
 
 In doing completing this project, I've gained a lot of appreciation for all the things that come with modern languages. Having written my own error messages, I appreciate the effort it took to give the details we come to expect with standard error messages.
 
For the longest time, writing a lisp interpreter has been a rite of passage for computer programming and I'm glad to have done it.
